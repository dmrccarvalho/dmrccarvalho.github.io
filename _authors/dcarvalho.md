description: >- 
    With seven years of working experience and a Master's degree in Software Engineering, I've been learning about programming and other computer-related subjects, like RDBMSes, data structures and algorithms, Operating Systems concepts (e.g. mutexes, semaphores, pipes, shared memory, memory mapped files, etc.), and so on.
    <br><br>
    Regarding programming languages, during my time in the University I used mainly Python, C, C++, and Java. I also developed an Android application as part of a group project. Later on, I started working in OutSystems, a low code platform that can be extended with C#.
    <br>
    Recently, I delved into the world of functional programming and learned Scala. Then, and because I always felt happier working in C, I also learned Rust. Both are awesome, each in its own way.
    <br><br>
    I am Portuguese, but I also speak English and Spanish fluently.
